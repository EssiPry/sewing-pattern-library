## Sewing Pattern Library

The Sewing Pattern Library helps users to keep track of the sewing patterns they own. Registered users can search for the patterns in the database or they may add new patterns to the database if the sewing pattern is not already there. 

In the future users will be able to add the patterns to their personal libraries and search the personal library. Users will be able add notes to the patterns in their personal library, these notes will not be visible to other users. Users will be able write pattern reviews that will be readble by other users.

Test the app at [Heroku](https://sewing-pattern-library.herokuapp.com/). 

Current test data for patterns includes patterns named B6354, B6414, 6808, Moneta, Coco, and Arielle. You can also search for partial names. 
Please note that pattern name or numerical code needs to be unique when adding new patterns to the database.
