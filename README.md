## Sewing Pattern Library

The Sewing Pattern Library helps users to keep track of the sewing patterns they own. The users can search for the patterns in the database. They will be able to add the patterns to their own library and add new patterns to the database if the sewing pattern is not already in the database. The users will be able add their notes to the patterns in their library, these notes will not be visible to other users. The users will be able read and write pattern reviews to the database that will be visible to other users.
