## Sewing Pattern Library

The Sewing Pattern Library helps users to keep track of the sewing patterns they own. Registered users can search for the patterns in the database, and they can add new patterns to the database if the sewing pattern is not already there. Users can leave reviews of patterns. They can also add patterns to their personal library and delete patterns from their personal library.

Test the app on [Heroku](https://sewing-pattern-library.herokuapp.com/).

Current test data for patterns include patterns named B6354, B6414, 6808, Moneta, Coco, and Arielle and pattern companies include Butterick, Tilly and the Buttons, Mekkotehdas, New Look. You can search for partial names. Please note that the pattern name needs to be unique when adding new patterns to the database.
